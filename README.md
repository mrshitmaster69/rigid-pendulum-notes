# Rigid Pendulum Notes

# Question 1
How do you expect the rigid **pendulum** will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency of the **pendulum** (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the **pendulum**?

> I would expect the **pendulum** will not invert if the frequency of the drive is much lower than the frequency of the **pendulum**. I believe it would only invert if the frequency of the drive is much, much higher than the frequency of the **pendulum**.

# Question 2
If the **pendulum** is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the _pivot point_ moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?

> My guess is that the **pendulum** will become further displaced if the _pivot_ point moves down abruptly while the pendulum is slightly displaced

# Question 3
If we start the **pendulum** oriented above its _pivot_ point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior? 

> The **pendulum** may stop falling if the pivot point moves down.
